Modal-style sandbox API on top of Hugging Face Jobs.

```python
from hf_sandbox import Sandbox

sb = Sandbox.create(image="python:3.12")
proc = sb.exec("python", "-c", "print(1+1)"). # → CompletedProcess(returncode=0, stdout='2\n', ...)
sb.write_file("/tmp/foo.txt", "hello")
print(sb.read_file("/tmp/foo.txt"))         . # → 'hello'
sb.terminate()
```

## How it works

`Sandbox.create()` launches an HF Job that:

1. `pip install`s a tiny FastAPI RPC server (FastAPI + uvicorn)
2. starts the server on `localhost:8000`
3. opens a free [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) so the master process can reach it

The client polls the job logs for the tunnel URL, then talks to the sandbox over plain HTTPS.

`exec`, `write_file`, `read_file` are simple authenticated POSTs.
`terminate()` cancels the job.

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/hf-sandbox.git
```

Requires `huggingface-cli login` (the same token is forwarded to the sandbox so it can access HF Hub).

## Limits

- Image must have Python + `pip` (used to install the RPC server and download `cloudflared`).
- Cloudflare's free `trycloudflare.com` URLs are best-effort — fine for benchmarks, not production.

## Security

The sandbox runs **untrusted code by design**. A few things to be aware of:

- **HF token forwarding is opt-in.** By default, your HF token is *not* exposed to the sandbox. Pass `forward_hf_token=True` to `Sandbox.create()` if your workload needs it. With it enabled, anything running inside the sandbox can read the token from `/proc/self/environ` and use it to act as you on the Hub.
- **Cloudflare sees all tunnel traffic.** Requests, responses, and the auth token transit Cloudflare's infrastructure (via `trycloudflare.com`). They state they don't log it, but it's a trust relationship. Don't run sensitive workloads through it.
- **Auth token** is a 256-bit random URL-safe string per sandbox, sent as `Bearer` on every authenticated endpoint. The tunnel URL alone gets you nothing.

## Telemetry

`hf-sandbox` reports anonymous usage data to help us understand how the library is used. Two events are sent per sandbox:

- `hf-sandbox/create` — flavor, timeout, whether `forward_hf_token` was set, and a random per-sandbox session id
- `hf-sandbox/terminate` — same session id, duration in seconds, and termination reason

We never send: the image name, commands, file paths, file contents, the tunnel URL, the auth token, your HF token, your username, or anything from inside the sandbox.

Disable by setting `HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` (or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`).
